## Design Philosophy

### Before
- **Emoji-heavy**: Multiple emojis in titles, headings, and buttons
- **Casual appearance**: Looked like a personal blog rather than professional portfolio
- **No visual categorization**: All blog cards looked the same
- **Inconsistent styling**: Different approaches across pages

### After
- **Professional**: Clean, modern design without distracting emojis
- **Color-coded system**: Clear visual hierarchy by specialization
- **Consistent**: Unified design language across all pages
- **Accessible**: Better contrast and readability

## Color Palette

### Category Colors
- **Machine Learning**: `#7c3aed` (Purple) - Tech/AI association
- **Genomics**: `#059669` (Green) - Biology/Life sciences
- **Chemistry**: `#d97706` (Amber) - Chemical/Physical sciences

### Badge Gradients
- **ML**: `#f3e8ff → #e9d5ff` with `#d8b4fe` border
- **Genomics**: `#d1fae5 → #a7f3d0` with `#6ee7b7` border
- **Chemistry**: `#fef3c7 → #fde68a` with `#fcd34d` border

## Impact on Site Quality
