# Welcome to My Research Hub

I'm an **AI Research Scientist** specializing in the intersection of artificial intelligence, machine learning, and biological systems. With 6+ years of experience developing predictive models and scalable pipelines for genomic, transcriptomic, and imaging data.

Currently pursuing my **PhD in Computer Science** at Old Dominion University, I focus on deep learning, uncertainty modeling, and transfer learning for biomedical applications.
