## 🚀 How to Deploy

Since your existing notebooks are already rendered, you likely have one of these workflows:

### Option A: If you have Quarto CLI installed
```bash
# From your mysite directory
quarto render vector-databases-demystified.ipynb
# Or render entire site
quarto render
```

### Option B: If using RStudio/Quarto GUI
1. Open the notebook in RStudio or Quarto preview
2. Click "Render" button
3. It will generate the HTML in the `docs/` folder

### Option C: If using VS Code with Quarto extension
1. Open vector-databases-demystified.ipynb
2. Use Command Palette: "Quarto: Render"
3. HTML will be generated automatically

### Option D: Using Python nbconvert (fallback)
```bash
jupyter nbconvert --to html --execute vector-databases-demystified.ipynb
mv vector-databases-demystified.html docs/
```

---

## 🔍 Expected Output

After rendering, you should see:

**In `docs/` folder:**
- `vector-databases-demystified.html` (new file)
- Updated `ml-blog.html` with new featured post

**On your website:**
- New post card at top of ML blog page
- Full interactive notebook with all visualizations
- Working code examples and FAISS benchmarks

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### If Quarto is not in PATH:
```bash
# Find Quarto installation
/Applications/quarto/bin/quarto --version

# Add to PATH (in ~/.zshrc or ~/.bash_profile)
export PATH="/Applications/quarto/bin:$PATH"
```

### If notebook doesn't render:
1. Check that first cell is raw cell type (not markdown)
2. Verify YAML frontmatter syntax
3. Try rendering other notebooks first to test setup

### If FAISS code doesn't run on render:
- Quarto executes notebooks during render
- Make sure conda environment is active
- Or use `execute: false` in YAML to skip execution
