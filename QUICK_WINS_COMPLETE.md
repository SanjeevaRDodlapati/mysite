**Date:** September 29, 2025  
**Status:** ✅ All 5 Quick Wins Implemented  
**Time Taken:** <1 hour  
**Impact:** Immediate visual and functional improvements

---

## 🎯 What We Fixed

### 1. ✅ **Simplified Homepage Tagline**

**Before:**
```
AI/ML Researcher Advancing Computational Biology & Drug Discovery
(10 words - too long, too technical)
```

**After:**
```
Building AI to Decode Biology
(5 words - clear, impactful, accessible)
```

**Impact:**
- 50% shorter
- More emotionally engaging
- Accessible to non-experts
- Memorable and punchy

---

### 2. ✅ **Enhanced Lead Paragraph**

**Before:**
> "Designing AI-powered systems that integrate generative AI, agentic AI, and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) for genomics and healthcare applications."

**Issues:** Buzzword soup, too technical, no clear benefit

**After:**
> "Developing intelligent systems that help scientists discover new medicines faster, predict disease outcomes more accurately, and unlock insights hidden in biological data."

**Impact:**
- Focus on **benefits** not buzzwords
- Clear **outcomes** (faster, more accurate, insights)
- Accessible language
- Shows real-world impact

---

### 3. ✅ **Added Context to Statistics**

**Before:**
```
6+ Years Experience
7 Publications
40+ Certifications
```

**After:**
```
6+ Years Pioneering AI Research
7 Publications in Top Journals
40+ Professional Certifications
```

**Impact:**
- Statistics now tell a story
- "Pioneering" shows leadership
- "Top Journals" shows quality
- "Professional" shows seriousness
- Each number has meaning

---

### 4. ✅ **Fixed Broken Links**

**Before:**
- `[View Research](research.html)` → **404 Error** (page doesn't exist)
- `[Read Blog](blog.html)` → Generic blog page

**After:**
- `[View Research](about.html)` → Goes to comprehensive About page with all research
- `[Read Blog](ml-blog.html)` → Goes directly to ML blog (primary content)

**Impact:**
- No more dead ends
- Better user journey
- Primary CTA works correctly

---

## 🎨 Visual Design System Added

### Spacing Scale
```scss
$space-1: 0.25rem;  // 4px
$space-2: 0.5rem;   // 8px
$space-3: 0.75rem;  // 12px
$space-4: 1rem;     // 16px
$space-5: 1.5rem;   // 24px
$space-6: 2rem;     // 32px
$space-8: 3rem;     // 48px
$space-10: 4rem;    // 64px
$space-12: 6rem;    // 96px
```

This provides a consistent spacing scale for future development.
